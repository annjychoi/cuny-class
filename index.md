## Syllabus

**Course Description**

This three-credit course introduces students to conceptualizing and producing content across multiple platforms--from Web sites to tablets and mobile devices-- by exploring essential concepts, tools and interactive story forms.This course introduces students to how the news industry is adapting to new technologies and ways to map or illustrate data and news. Students will also explore ways to add interactivity to audio and visual storytelling. More specifically, this course introduces students to the basics of HTML/CSS.They'll also leverage existing platforms . We'll explore all these tools and technologies within the journalistic context of pitching, reporting, producing data and interactive-rich news packages.

The course covers fundamental technical skills that will serve as the foundation for your interactive work at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism.

**Course Learning Objectives**

You will leave this course with experience in:

* Producing journalism for the web or mobile device
* Building basic HTML pages and layouts
* Manipulating web content design using CSS
* Using an FTP client to publish content online
* Finding and using data responsibly and effectively
* Learning the math required to effectively analyze data
* Producing basic maps and charts that convey information clearly and at a glance
* Reporting and producing stories with data and interactivity
* Crafting questions to ensure receive technical guidance from web programming communities

**Instructor**

I'm Ann Choi Fitzpatrick. My byline is Ann Choi. I'm a data and investigative reporter for THE CITY. Previously, I worked at Newsday and Sun Sentinel.

I am most comfortable with finding data, analyzing it in a spreadsheet or R. I often am required to turn my analysis into charts or maps for my editors, well before I write up a draft. I also work closely with developers and graphic reporters in the newsroom.  

I'm excited to teach this course  because it encompasse a lot of skills that I use everyday and they are highly sought after in the industry. 

You might already know that you have no plans to become a web developer, designer or data reporter.  Still, being able to communicate your reporting in interactive and data-driven terms will carry your stories much farther. Also, you will make allies with varied backgrounds in your newsroom more easily because you will have basic understanding (and appreciation) of their expertise. 

Lastly, I also attended a graduate school for a journalism degree (hook'em!), I'd like to think that we already have something in common. Please don't hesitate to ask for help or any questions.

### Grading Rubric

In assessing students' final project, the instructor will focus on the following factors:
*	Process: Were the drafts iterated and improved based on faculty feedback?
*	Quality and Shine: Is it executed with skill and subtlety, and has it been edited well and polished?
*	Organization and Presentation: Is it presented clearly and in a professional manner suitable for an audience?
*	Effort and Application: Has the work been prepared with careful thought and attention to detail, and does it take appropriate advantage of the relevant tools?
*	Punctuality and Completeness: Is it on time and complete, and does it fulfill the assignment?

**For Discussions**
*	Preparedness: Has the student completed the work necessary in preparation for the discussion (viewing assigned video, completing assigned reading or tutorial)?
*	Participation: Was the student engaged in the discussion (both paying attention and participating)?
For In-class Exercises
*	Effort: Did the student try to complete the exercise to better understand the lesson at hand?
*	Participation: If the exercise involves collaboration, did the student contribute?

**Assignment Values**
Grading for individual assignments is based on the quality of the finished work:
* A: High quality student work with minimal editing required.
* B: Good quality student work.
* C: Unsatisfactory work.
* D: Painfl to review. 
* F: Atrocious, unacceptable work.

**Attendance**
You will loose one grade point for each unexcused absence. Let me know at least three days in advance if you will be absent and why.  

Assignment|	Percentage Value
--------- | -----------
In-class participation/professionalism|10%
HTML/CSS Assignment|25%
Data-viz Assignment|25%
Map Assignment|25%
Attendance|15%
Total|100%

### Deadlines

You must meet deadlines by filing your assignments no later than due date and time. Missing a deadline results in an automatic half-grade reduction. Your grade will continue to drop by half a grade for each subsequent day after the deadline until you file your assignment.  

Plan ahead and remember that in journalism: done is better than perfect. It will always be better to hand in something than nothing. If you are having trouble with your assignment let me know immediately, do not wait until it is too late.

Extra credit
Any student can get two extra credit points added to their final grade, if they:
* Find a piece of (recent) interesting data and/or interactive journalism
* Come up with a short list of things they like and dislike about the piece
* Interview someone who worked on the piece about their process
* Give a short presentation (~5-10 minutes) to the class on the piece
Only two students can present per class for this, on a first come, first served basis.

### Plagiarism and Copyright
It is a serious ethical violation to take any material created by another person and represent it as your own original work. Any such plagiarism will result in serious disciplinary action, possibly including dismissal from the CUNY J-School. Plagiarism may involve copying text from a book or magazine without attributing the source, or lifting words, code, photographs, videos, or other materials from the Internet and attempting to pass them off as your own. Please ask the instructor if you have any questions about how to distinguish between acceptable research and plagiarism.

In addition to being a serious academic issue, copyright is a serious legal issue.

Never "lift" or "borrow" or "appropriate" or "repurpose" graphics, audio, or code without both permission and attribution. This guidance applies to scripts, audio, video clips, programs, photos, drawings, and other images, and it includes images found online and in books.
Create your own graphics, seek out images that are in the public domain or shared via a creative commons license that allows derivative works, or use images from the AP Photo Bank or which the school has obtained licensing.

If you’re repurposing code, be sure to keep the original licensing intact. If you’re not sure how to credit code, ask.

The exception to this rule is fair use: if your story is about the image itself, it is often acceptable to reproduce the image. If you want to better understand fair use, the Citizen Media Law Project is an excellent resource.

When in doubt: ask.

### Importance of Diversity
It's critical that students learn to include a diverse set of voices in their stories -- something that is often glossed over when telling stories through charts and graphics. You are encouraged to look for stories about and voices from communities that are underrepresented.
