## Interacitivty & Data

#### Classes: Thursdays, 5:30 - 8:30 pm. 

**Instructor**
I'm Ann. My byline is Ann Choi. I'm a data and investigative reporter for Newsday. 

I am most comfortable with cleaning up and analyzing data in a spreadsheet or R but I often am required to my analysis into charts or maps and work closely with web developers and designers in the newsroom.  

You might know that you are not a visual person or a developer and don't have any strong desire to develop these specific skills but knowing the fundamentals and being able to communicate your reporting and writing in interactive terms will carry your stories further.  
Previously, I worked at the Sun Sentinel, Miami Herald, Austin American-Statesman and KUT, an NPR affiliate in Austin, Texas. 

Because I also attended a graduate school for a journalism degree (hook'em!), I'd like to think that we already have something in common. Please ask away all questions.
